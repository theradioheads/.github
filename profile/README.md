## Welcome to **The Radio Heads!**
**(Formerly MyJri Radio)**

---

Weâ€™re a passionate crew of music lovers here to provide you with free music streaming and a "Create Your Own Radio" option to spin your own jams.

You may remember us as **MyJri Radio**, but weâ€™ve decided to part ways with Jri because, well... letâ€™s just say we werenâ€™t vibing with the limitations of their hosting and music setup. So, weâ€™ve rebranded and are doing our own thing now.

### Quick Note:  
Some of our old stuff still carries the MyJri Radio name. Weâ€™re actively working on cleaning that up, so bear with us. ðŸ˜…

### For Free MyJri Radio Users:  
We know this is a bit of a pain, but since we had to migrate everything over, **all MyJri Radio URLs got shut down** in the process. ðŸ˜¬ Apologies for the hassle! Weâ€™re setting up a new URL for your radios, but since weâ€™re still getting everything in place, it might take a couple of weeks. Donâ€™t worry though, weâ€™ll send you a **JriMail** with the new link and all the details as soon as it's ready.

### For Self-Hosters:  
Good news, you donâ€™t have to pay the **MyJri Host price** anymore! ðŸŽ‰ Due to our new billing setup, weâ€™re switching things up. **All self-hosters have been refunded** for their previous payments, and youâ€™ll now become a **Radio Master** at no extra cost! ðŸŽ§ Thatâ€™s right â€” **Radio Master accounts are free for existing members**.

You still have full control over your stations, but with even better perks and no monthly fees. Thank you for sticking with us, and weâ€™re excited to keep the music going!

<!---If youâ€™re a self-hosting user, youâ€™ll need to update your credentials. You can find the steps to do that in this [guide](https://github.com/theradioheads/READ_ME_SELF_HOSTERS).-->
If youâ€™re a self-hosting user, youâ€™ll need to update your credentials. We are working on a guide on how to do this, but if you know what to do, you'll have to do it!

### For MyJri Radio +, Pro, and Pro+ Users:  
Weâ€™ve issued a refund to all accounts that were paying for the service. Weâ€™re changing up the billing setup, and now that weâ€™re our own thing, it should be **cheaper** for you! ðŸŽ‰ 

That said, this means your radios will be down for now (unless youâ€™re a self-hosted user), but weâ€™ll prioritize getting your stations back online ASAP. Hang tight, weâ€™re on it!

### The Future Is Fast:
Weâ€™re no longer stuck with Jri's constraints, so weâ€™re making major upgrades. One of the big things weâ€™re working on is a prototype with **heavy cache**. Instead of a *requested decode* system, weâ€™re switching to a *cached decode* system. This means your tunes will load up to **7x faster** than before. ðŸŽ§ðŸ’¨

Itâ€™s still a work in progress, but weâ€™re excited about it and will keep you posted!
